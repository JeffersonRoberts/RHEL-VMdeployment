# RHEL-VMdeployment
Deployment of RHEL OS in to a base VM

-Create new VM, Not from Template

-Attach OS installion media. 

-Use a Kickstart file to install new OS. 

The goal of this is to be able to deploy new RHEL servers regardless of the version of RHEL. If new versions are downloaded it is just changing the ISO that gets attached.
